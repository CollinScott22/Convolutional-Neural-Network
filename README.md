# Convolutional-Neural-Network

This is a Convolutional Neural Network that was a part of my senior research project.

The project utilizes the TensorFlow library created by Google.

I worked on this project alongside 2 others; You Cao and Muchen Ge.

I worked on data collection and management along with intergroup relations with another group who did a similar project.

I also worked almost exclusively with the app, sharing and shaping ideas with the other group mentioned earlier to create a shared version of the app using html.

I did some work on the Neural Network as well but most of the final work on that front was done by my groupmates.
